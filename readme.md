Author: Lionel Brouy√®re

### Description
This is a really simple tool to scuplt a mesh on top of a deformation chain. 
It usefull for geometry finalization and help artist to create animated corrective directly on vertexes. It works whatever the setup/rigging/deformer who drive the mesh (if the geo and the vertexe aren't locked).  
Carreful, this is not a rigging tool, this is for shot finalization.
